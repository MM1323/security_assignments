Question #1
Describe the protocol you agreed upon with your classmates in English (no code) in
enough detail that someone else could implement it. 

WHAT THE CLASS DISCUSSED:
- AES that involves json
- EAX mode for the cipher
- Putting it in ciphertext, nonce and then tag order
- Using a hybrid approach where they swap public keys


WHAT WE DID:
For the key exchange, we agreed to use Diffie-Hellman with two shared keys. 

When the server sends the message, we used the second shared key to encode 
the message. We then truncated the key to be 16 bytes. When the client sends the
message, we used the first shared key to send the message and truncated the key to be 16 bytes.
For both keys, we encoded it by ("ISO-8859-1"). For both the client and the server, we 
used a AES cipher and made it with their respective keys. Finally, we then concatenated
the user input in this order: ciphertext, nonce, and tag.

When we process the received message, we separated the ciphertext and nonce. 
When is the server receiving the message, we used the first shared key and truncate 
it to the first 16 bytes. When its the client receiving the message, we used the second
shared key and truncate it to the first 16 bytes. For both the server and client,
we used their respective keu and nonce to create the cipher with AES. Finally, we
decrypted the message into plaintext by using the cipher and encoded it. When then return
the plaintext decoded by ("ISO-8859-1").

Question #2
Describe two pros of the protocol you agreed upon with your classmates.

First: We don't have to worry about public/private key pairs and swapping them

Second: Defends confidentiality and integrity

Question #3
Describe two cons of the protocol you agreed upon with your classmates.

First: Their is a chance that the sent message does not get decrypted correctly.

Second: Its sustainable to Man in the Middle attacks

Question #4
Thinking like a defender, what/who do you have to trust in order to be confident
that messages sent using your SecureMessaging.py cannot be obtained by an adversary and why? 
Describe at least THREE entities you must trust.  

First: PyCryptodome library to generate all needed random numbers

Second: pyDH library to implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange

Third: AES to create the cipher

Question #5
Thinking like an attacker, how might an adversary still compromise the confidentiality or 
integrity of a message sent to a classmate using your SecureMessaging.py? 
Describe at least TWO potential attacks. 

First: Using a man in the middle attack 

Second: An attacker takes either the clients or servers public keys and identity

Question #6 (ungraded)
How did you divide the work between partners? (Put N/A if worked alone)

So Mia did the majority of the coding. Andrew helped from time to time, mainly
with creating the outline on what needed to code.

Question #7 (optional, ungraded)
Did you use code snippets from anywhere online that you need to cite?
