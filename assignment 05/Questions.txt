COSC 311 Assignment #5: Anonymization

Question #1
The CensusData.csv file was released without k-anonymization or l-diversification. 
Do you think this was an OK decision from a privacy perspective? Why or why not?

No, this decision is not okay. First, from this data set you could pin point a 
single person since there are some datapoints which are unique from all of the data 
points in the data. Additionally, you could also combine this dataset and another
one to pin point a specific person and get more data about them. In general,
released without k-anonymization or l-diversificatio data reveals a lot of data on a
many different people.

Question #2
How did you attempt to limit the amount of imprecision introduced by your 
k-anonymization algorithm?

One way we attempted to limit the amount of imprecision introduced was to move through
the dataframe containing groups smaller than k (data2) in subGroups of size k. Since 
the data that was contained in data2 was already sorted prior to being entered into data2,
iloc-ing data2 into subGroups of size k typically grouped rows with a large number of
similarities. This meant that when we modified the values in these subGroups (lines 82 to
87), we typically didn't have to change the values of all of the categories.

Question #3
How does the runtime of your k-anonymize.py scale with argument k 
(in big-O notation)? To test this, examine the structure of your code and/or time 
the script for increasing values of k.

The runtime of k-anonymize.py scales inversely with k. More specifically, as k gets larger,
the runtime gets shorter. However, in terms of big-o notation, k has no impact of the runtime
of k-anonymize.py which will always be O(n), with "n" referring to the size of CensusData.csv. 
This is a result of the subGroups described in question 2. Since the size of the subGroups and
by extension, the amount of times the for-loop beginning on line 81 is going to run is dependent
on the size of k, a larger k value results in less loops. However, this won't affect big-O runtime
given that this code will always use at least 2 full for-loops of the data in CensusData.csv and 
in the worst case, will use 3 for-loops (O(3n) ≈ O(2n) ≈ O(n)). Taken to the extreme, a k value of 
32561 will result in a big-o runtime of O(n).

Question #4
How does the runtime of your k-anonymize.py algorithm scale with the number of rows 
in the dataset (in big-O notation)? To test this, examine the structure of your
code and/or time the script when run on increasingly larger slices of CensusData.csv

As the number of rows increases, the runtime of our algorithm scales linearly. This is 
because it iterate through the all of the rows and group them by k if they are not 
k anonymized. If there are more rows, then we would group more rows of size k in order
to k-anonymize the data set.

Similarly, if the number of rows decreases, then the runtime would scales linearly downward.
This is because less rows in the data set would have to be grouped by k. 

Therefore, it would still remain O(n) because of the properties above above where when the
amount of rows increase or decrease, it would scale linearly.

Question #5

What do you think is the lowest value of L (for ldiversify.py) that provides 
sufficient privacy for the sensitive EducationNum attribute? Why? 

The lowest L value we think provides sufficient enough privacy is the k value of the 
given dataset. For a given group it would allow for enough diversity proportional to the k value. 
This is because it would allow for a subGroup of data to be at least k Diverse and with k diversity
to the sensitive attribute. This would allow for enough of the data to not to be changed and be 
overall usable and while also being private enough with enough given sensitive attributes.

Question #6 (ungraded)
How did you divide the work between partners? (Put N/A if worked alone)

While we worked together when we could, we both worked on our own if our schedules made
it so we couldn't meet up. Additionally, we split the questions for this text file evenly
but we discussed the questions together as we were writing them.
