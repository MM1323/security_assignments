COSC 311 Assignment #6: Usable Privacy

Question #1
Since this is a homework assignment and not a research project, we are skipping several important
considerations that would be essential for a real user study. List three modifications that would
need to be made to the experimental method in Part 2 to make it a properly controlled study.

First, instead of letting each person do there own timing with someone they know, we would
get random people to do the timing.

Second, we would would use the same phone/computer and timer to get the time for both the expert and
typical user. Doing this would eliminate the variablity in speed due to the devices being different.

Finally, we would limit the OS and browers tested. Additionally, we would test the same amount of
people for each device we pick. We would do this to make the data collected very clear and
concise.

Question #2
Provide a caption for your figure with the data from Part 1.

This figure displayes the average number of interactions for turning off the GPS location services and
delete/disable third-party cookies based on the OS and the brower used. Out of all of the iOS
brower combinations, iOS + Firefox took the most interactions to complete both tasks.

Question #3
Provide a caption for your figure with the data from Part 2.

This figure displayes the average time difference between a typical and a expert user on adjusting
privacy settings on different OSs and browers. Out of all of the iOS brower combinations,
Android + Chrome took the longest for typical users to adjust privacy settings. Additionally,
iOS/Android + Chrome took the longest for expert users to adjust privacy settings.

Question #4
Choose one takeaway from the data and figures. Describe its implications for software developers
and designers attempting to balance privacy customization options and user-friendliness.


Based on both figures, Chrome consistently took alot of time and interactions in order to change
privacy settings on both iOS and Android. This suggests that the Chrome design is not
very user-friendly and should not be followed as a good example for software developers
and designers. However, not following Chrome design could negatively impact software developers
and designers since it seems to be very popular among both iOS and Android users based on
that data collected.

Question #7 (optional, ungraded)
Do you have any suggestions for improving this assignment in the future?

I would have liked to see what the original longer project was supposed to be.
