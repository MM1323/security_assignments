Question #1
Why is it necessary to identify malicious hosts in order to stop port scans in real traffic?
Why isn't identifying SYN-only flows sufficient?

One option for a DOS attack is through a TCP SYN flood attack. In this attack the attacker sends
Many SYN packets to the server, exhausting the server's TCP buffer with half-open connections.
Therefore, we want to identify malicious hosts by scanning for hosts either sending packets to
known bad ports or sending many SYN-only packets. When an attacker consistently sends SYN packets
To the server, the server engages in the TCP "three-way handshake" and opens connection with the
SYN packet. This results in many half-open connections as the attacker continues to send SYN packets
But does not respond to the server's ACK's, leaving the server's resources exhausted with half-
Open connections. However, there is an issue with identifying and stopping SYN-only flows. By
Blocking hosts sending syn-only packets or packets to known bad ports, we are preventing potential
TCP SYN flood attacks. However, just because the packet is SYN-only does not necessarily mean the
client is malicious. While the server can filter and block certain packets based on unexpected
behaviors such as unusual high traffic volume, high rates of TCP SYN packets, or unexpected
destination addresses, there is no guarantee that the host the server is blocking is truly malicious
rather than the client acting out of character. Therefore, identifying SYN-only flows doesn't
Guarantee that the server is blocking only malicious hosts.

Question #2
Choose 2 IP addresses in the set of "malicious hosts" and see what you can find out about them
using the "whois" command and searching online. Report your most interesting findings below.

The two IP's that researched came from companies that come from places like Russia, China, and the
Philippines which have questionable reliance in history. Also, both have an aribitaray location and
fake name listed when doing the whois on the command line. This makes this IP very suspcious since
you really don't know who has that IP address.

Question #3
A threshold of 100 is the default for the Bro algorithm.
Given the results in your sensitivity curve plot, why do you think this value was chosen?
What are the pros and cons of choosing a higher or lower threshold?

The plotted sensitivity curve shows exponential decay. This suggests that the initial increase
In threshold heavily affects the number of hosts being blocked. Once the threshold is set past a
certain value, the increase in blocked hosts will plateau. A lower threshold in the bro algorithm
Means that hosts will be blocked for a smaller amount of suspicious activity (sending syn-only packets
And sending packets to not known good ports to internal ip's). The algorithm with a lower thresholds
could be unintentionally blocking Benign hosts that occasionally act in a suspicious manner. The
higher the threshold, the more likely it is that the host is truly malicious as they're sending
potentially malicious packets to more and more internal ip addresses. Given the sensitivity plot,
the amount of hosts being blocked starts plateauing around 20. From around 20 to 80 the number of
blocked hosts decreases slightly but continues plateau and stabilize. Once the threshold hits 100
there appears to be little, if any change in the number of hosts blocked. Therefore, 100 is a good
value to choose as it appears to be the lowest threshold value that is blocking consistently the
approximately same number of hosts sending to over 100 internal ip's. While a threshold of 100 seems
Like a reasonable threshold for the csv file we were given, for a large internal organization, a
threshold of 100 might not be as reasonable a threshold to detect a malicious host. Similarly,
for a small organization, a threshold of 100 might be too large to properly detect malicious hosts.
I believe that the threshold value should reflect both the amount of internal ip addresses there
are in an organization and the security needs of that organization (if it needs to be
more conservative in blocking hosts or not).

Question #4
A threshold of 100 would have blocked ~115 hosts (if your implementation didn't,
you should check it for bugs). This is many fewer hosts than the number of malicious hosts
found in Part 3. What differences between the Bro algorithm and the method used in Part 3
caused this difference? Which method do you think is more likely to be accurate? Why?

While both parts of the homework block malicious hosts, they have separate filtering systems. In
Part 3 we are blocking any external IP address that either sends a SYN-only packet, or any packet
That is sent to a known bad port. Part 3 writes any IP address that violates this filtering system
As malicious hosts. The bro algorithm follows a similar filtration system, it notes the external ip
addresses that send syn-only packets or sends packets to any port other than the listed "good" ports.
However, the bro algorithm doesn't mark the host as malicious when it first finds the external IP
address acting suspicious. Instead, it only marks the host as malicious when it finds that the external
IP address is sending suspicious packets to multiple internal ip addresses. When the number of internal
Ip addresses per host IP address reaches a certain threshold it then blocks the host and lists it
As malicious. As discussed in question 1, there are cons to server filtration. The filter seen in
Part 3 marks hosts as malicious the first time they send potentially malicious packets. The rigid
structure of this filter leaves the potential for benign hosts to be blocked simply because
They acted in a out of character. Therefore, to reduce the chance of blocking benign hosts, the
bro algorithm takes the filter of part 3 and adds to it. Rather than block immediately, the bro algorithm
will only mark an IP address as malicious if it consistently sends syn-only packets or sends packets
to not known good ports. After a certain threshold of destination ip addresses is reached, the
host is finally deemed malicious. This technique reduces the chances of accidentally marking benign
hosts as malicious as it blocks hosts that continue to act in a suspicious manner to multiple internal
ip's rather than immediately blocking an External ip the first time its behavior is potentially
malicious.
