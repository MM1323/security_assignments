Question #1
Although you used a new browser for this assignment, does that completely prevent trackers from 
associating your browsing activity in the assignment from your normal everyday browsing? 
Justify your answer with technical details.

No, it does not. This is mainly due to Deterministic CDT and Probabilistic CDT. For example,
when a user signs into a website on a different devise, they are the same userID which that website 
uses when sending a cookie back to its self to know that the user visited that site regardless 
what device they are using.
